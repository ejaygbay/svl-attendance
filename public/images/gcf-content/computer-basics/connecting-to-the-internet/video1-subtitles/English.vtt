00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.669
There are a lot of reasons to set up a home
internet connection. For example, you'll have

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.789
access to email, news, shopping, TV shows,
and much more. And once you have a working

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.460
internet connection, you can create a wireless
home network, which will let your whole family

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.180
connect their computers, smartphones, and
other internet-ready devices.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.479
There are different types of internet connections
that you can have. Dial-up connects to your

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.089
phone line. It's usually much slower than
other types of internet connections, but in

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.710
some areas it may be the only option available.
Generally, DSL and Cable are better options.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.620
DSL plugs into your phone line, and cable
uses your cable TV connection. These are both

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.000
known as broadband internet connections because
they offer much faster speeds than dial-up.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.600
This makes it easier to watch videos, play
games, or browse the web.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.319
3G and 4G are types of wireless internet connections
often used by smartphones, but you can also

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:21.420
get these types of connections for your home.
Depending on where you live, 3G or 4G may

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.869
be a good broadband alternative to DSL and
Cable.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.340
No matter what kind of internet service you
choose, you'll need to purchase it from an

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.759
Internet Service Provider, or ISP. Chances
are, you can buy internet service from your

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.920
phone or cable company, or you may want to
shop around for a better price.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.989
Your ISP will guide you through the entire
process of connecting to the internet. They'll

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:48.520
usually need to send a technician to your
home to turn on your connection. Your ISP

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.099
may also give you a modem and set it up for
you. But if you prefer, you can buy a modem

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.060
from a computer store and use the included
instructions to set it up yourself. These

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.450
instructions will vary, but the basic idea
is that you'll connect the modem to your phone

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.160
jack or cable TV connection, and then connect
your computer to the modem using an Ethernet

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.069
cable. Once you have everything set up,
you can open

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.860
your web browser and begin using the internet.
If you want to connect several devices to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.220
the internet, or if you just want the freedom
to use your laptop without cables, you can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.150
create a wireless home network, also known
as a Wi-Fi network. To do this, you'll need

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.900
a wireless router, which takes the internet
connection from your modem and broadcasts

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180
it throughout your home. Your modem may already
have a wireless router built-in, so you may

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.370
not need to buy one.
To set up your wireless connection, follow

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.379
the instructions included with your router.
You'll need to choose a network name, also

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:54.379
known as an SSID. Also, for security, you
should turn on WPA or WPA2 encryption, and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.749
make sure you choose a strong password.
After you've set up your wireless network,

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:07.749
go into each device's Wi-Fi or Network settings,
select your network name, and type your password.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.889
If any of your devices aren't wireless ready,
you can simply plug them into your router

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.810
with an Ethernet cable, or you can purchase
a wireless card.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.079
Setting up an internet connection and Wi-Fi
network takes a little bit of work, but once

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.819
you get it set up, your family will be able
to use the internet without being limited

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.830
to one computer.
