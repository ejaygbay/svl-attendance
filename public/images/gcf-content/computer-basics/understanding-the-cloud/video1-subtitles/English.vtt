Here you are, working at your computer. Huh,
what’s that noise? 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.080
SUDDENLY, A METEORITE CRASHES TO EARTH (specifically, 
into your living room). Sadly, your computer is no more,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.160
but thankfully, all your music, photos, and
important documents are stored online—in

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.370
the cloud. When something is stored in the
cloud, that means it’s stored on internet

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.809
servers instead of on your computer. It’s
like having an extra hard drive—one that

00:00:50.809 --> 00:01:02.760
you can access anywhere and anytime you’re
connected to the internet. In the past, you only 
had a home computer and the software you installed on it. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.580
Now you can take your files anywhere thanks to
cloud-based applications called web apps,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.049
which run inside your internet browser. A
web app that you may already use is Google

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.880
Docs. It’s free, you don’t have to install
anything to use it, and it allows you to create

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.359
several different types of projects. You can
access everything that you create in Google

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:31.770
Docs from any computer or device with an internet
connection. Since you only need a connected

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.140
device to access the cloud, you can take your
music, photos, and videos with you wherever

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.829
you go. For instance, if you take a photo
on your smartphone and upload it to a cloud-based

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.829
photo storage service like Flickr or Picasa,
you can access that photo on any of your other

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.890
devices, on your computer, or even on your
TV. 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.969
You can share your vacation photos with friends and family 
while you’re still on vacation. With your photos and other multimedia

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.150
stored in the cloud, you’ll never have to
worry about losing them to a computer malfunction—

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.190
or rogue meteorite – ever again. 
Storing files in the cloud is a great way to protect

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.500
your important files from accidents, viruses,
and more. You can use cloud-based storage

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.750
services like Mozy or Carbonite to back up
the contents of your computer. These services

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.830
run continually and back up automatically,
so you will always have the most recent versions

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.120
of your files stored in secure online servers.
If something bad happens to your computer,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.810
you can easily transfer your backup files
from your storage service to another device.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:58.819
So, what are you waiting for? No matter
how you use your computer, tablet, or smartphone,

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.819
the cloud has something to offer you. Whether
it’s checking your email when you’re traveling,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.920
backing up the photos and music that you love,
or using web apps to work in different locations,

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.690
the cloud can—and already is—making your
life, and the technology in it, more manageable.
