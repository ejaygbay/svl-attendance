A desktop computer is made up of several basic
parts, and in this video we're going to show

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.869
you what these parts are, and what they're
used for.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.769
The computer case contains the main components
of the computer. This is where the actual

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.149
processing happens. Today, most cases are
tower cases, which means they stand up vertically.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.670
Sometimes you may see a horizontal case,
which is often called a desktop case.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.850
In order to view anything on your computer,
you'll need to have a monitor. The monitor

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.850
connects to the video card inside your computer,
to display images and text on the screen.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.530
Most monitors have LCD or LED displays, which
can be made very thin, so they don't use much

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.300
desk space. To save even more space, you can
buy an all-in-one computer, which combines

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.069
the monitor and the computer case into a single
unit.

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.179
To interact with your computer, you'll need
a keyboard and mouse. Keyboards come in different

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:25.179
shapes and sizes: for example, ergonomic and
wireless keyboards. The mouse is used to control

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.990
the mouse pointer on the screen. It can either
be optical, which has an electronic eye on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.610
the bottom, or mechanical, which uses a rolling
ball to detect movement.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.259
Some people prefer to use a trackball or touchpad
instead of a mouse. These use less desk space,

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.880
since they don't need to move when you're
using them.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.609
So those are the basic parts of a desktop
computer. As you can see, each part plays

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.039
an important role, and you'll become very
familiar with these parts as you gain more

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.659
experience with your computer.
