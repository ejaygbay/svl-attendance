00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.230
Are you having trouble setting up your computer?
Are you feelingâ€¦ overwhelmed?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.800
Don't worry - take a deep breath.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.880
You already have everything you need; you
just need to put it together. Today I'm going

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.649
to show you - step by step - how to set up
a desktop computer.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.079
First, you'll want to unpack everything from
the box, and remove any plastic covering or

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
protective tape. Think about where you want
your workspace to go, and how you want the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.850
different components to be arranged. Now's
the time to decide before you start plugging

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.239
things in.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.780
Next, we're going to connect the monitor.
If you have an all-in-one computer, where

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.949
everything is built in (for example, an iMac),
you can skip this step. Otherwise, locate

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.160
your monitor cable, which should look something
like this. It might be blue to make it easier

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.740
to identify, or it might be a slightly different
shape; it just depends.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.810
Now find the monitor port on the back of your
computer case, and plug the cable in. Most

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.610
cables are designed to fit a certain way,
so if it's not working, don't force it. Make

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.350
sure you have the right one, then tighten
the screws to fix it in place.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.350
When you're done, connect the other end to
your monitor.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.469
Now it's time to plug in your keyboard and
mouse. For your keyboard, take a look at the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.469
cable. If it has a round PS/2 connector, plug
it into the purple port on the back of the

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.689
case. If it has a USB connector instead, you
can use any of the ports you see here.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.789
The same goes for your mouse. If it has a
light-green PS/2 connector, use the color-coded

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.969
port. If it has a USB, plug it in here. You
could also use the USB port on your keyboard

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.960
(if your keyboard has one).

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.210
If you have a wireless mouse or keyboard,
it's going to work a little differently. Some

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.619
connect using technology that's built into
your computer; others need an adapter. You

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.440
may want to read the instructions that came
with your wireless mouse or keyboard to find

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.090
out how it works.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.090
At this point, you should plug in your speakers
or headphones if you have some you want to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.930
use. Just look for the audio port on the front
or back of your computer case.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.930
Many computers have color-coding here, too.
The green port is for speakers or headphones.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.329
The blue port is what we call the line-in, which
can be used with other types of devices.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.680
Some speakers, headphones, and microphones
have USB connectors instead of the usual audio

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.000
plug. These can be plugged into any USB port.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Finally, it's time to connect the power supply
cables, and plug the computer in.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.940
Your computer should have come with two of
these. One goes with your monitor, and the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.299
other plugs into the back of your computer
case.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.220
Now plug both cables into a surge protector.
If you don't have one, you can plug the cables

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.269
directly into the wall. However, this is not
recommended. A power surge can damage your

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.639
computer if it's not plugged into a surge
protector.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.930
When you're ready, plug the surge protector
into a regular outlet. If yours has a power

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.269
switch, you may need to turn it on.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.949
That's all there is to it! Pretty simple,
huh? It sure is. Now you can take a minute

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.219
to make sure you're happy with your workspace,
then turn your computer on.
