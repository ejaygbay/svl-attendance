00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.950
Does staring at the computer for hours make
you feel… tired?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.110
Do you suffer from frequent aches and pains?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.020
Looks like you could use some help - with
ergonomics.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.320
Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific
discipline concerned with the understanding

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.100
of interactions among humans and other elements
of a system.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.890
Ahem.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.970
In other words, it's about you, and the things
you can do to make your workspace more comfortable.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.640
For example, using a computer involves a lot
of repetitive motions, like typing and using

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.940
the mouse. Over time, these motions can take
their toll on your body.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.280
If you arrange your workspace with ergonomics
in mind, you can avoid things like eye strain,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.890
and neck and back pain. Here are some tips
to help you stay comfortable and productive.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.020
Make sure you place your chair so you're sitting
in a natural, comfortable position. You may

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.640
need to adjust the height so your feet are
touching the ground.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.860
Mind your posture. Many office chairs are
even designed to give you extra support where

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.140
you need it; for example, in the lower back,
and on the arm rests.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.869
Position your keyboard at a comfortable height.
Your wrists should be straight and relaxed

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.200
to avoid any strain. A keyboard tray might
help, if your desk has one. You can also try

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640
an ergonomic keyboard, which generally has
extra support for your wrists - or a shape

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.390
designed to fit the natural placement of your
hands.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.830
If possible, place your mouse right next to
the keyboard. Otherwise, it's going to be

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.300
hard to reach. If you do start to feel any
pain, you might want to look into certain

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.069
products that can give you extra cushioning;
for example, a pad in front of your keyboard,

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.840
or this glove (designed to elevate and support
your wrist).

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.349
Your monitor should be a comfortable distance
away from your eyes - somewhere between 20-40

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.709
inches. It should also be at eye level or
slightly lower. This is your best chance of

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.270
reducing eye strain.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.430
Another way to avoid strain and fatigue is
to take frequent breaks. For example, look

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.030
away from the monitor every once in a while;
20-20-20 is a good rule to follow. Every 20

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.050
minutes, focus your eyes on an object 20 feet
away for 20 seconds.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.349
You can even download apps that'll remind
you when it's time to take a break. Basically,

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.719
you want to get up occasionally, walk around,
have a snack - whatever it takes to avoid

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.719
sitting in the same position for too long.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.920
Debris and general clutter is another thing
that can affect your productivity. It can

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.959
also lead to strain or injury if you're not
careful. So if you have paperwork or supplies

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.879
that can be put away, it's best to store them
somewhere instead of leaving them on your desk.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.319
Let's review.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.930
With a little attention to ergonomics, you
can take your workspace from this… to this.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.620
And that's all it takes to stay comfortable
and healthy while using your computer.
