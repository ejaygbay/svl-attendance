Did you know that you and your computer speak
different languages? It doesn’t speak Spanish,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:34.140
or Swedish, or Chinese; it speaks in ones
and zeroes. You can’t communicate directly

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.840
with your computer; that’s where your operating
system comes in. The operating system is the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.980
program that lets you interact with your
computer. Together, the operating system and

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.380
computer hardware form a complete system that
determines what your computer can do. There

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:05.280
are many different operating systems. Two
of the most common ones are Microsoft Windows

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:17.590
and Mac OS X. Windows comes preloaded on most
personal computers; Mac OS X runs on all new

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.130
Macs. Operating Systems aren’t just for
computers and laptops, though. Mobile devices

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:33.080
run mobile operating systems like Apple iOS
or Google Android. Operating systems for mobile

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.830
devices are designed for interactions with
smaller touch-screens. Before downloading

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.860
new software, or applications, to your computer
or mobile device, you should check to see

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.030
if the application is compatible with your
operating system. Some applications work on

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.810
all operating systems, but others only work
on certain ones. So, get to know your operating

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.760
system to see how it works and what it can
do.
