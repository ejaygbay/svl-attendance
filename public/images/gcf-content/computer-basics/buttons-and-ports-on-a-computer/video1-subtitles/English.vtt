00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.340
This is a typical desktop computer. It has
various buttons and ports on the front and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.180
back of the computer case. We’re going to
go over some of the most common ones, which

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.840
you’ll find on most desktop computers.
Let’s start with the front of the case.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.320
Most desktop computers have the power button
on the front, although some all-in-one computers

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.030
put it on the back, behind the screen.
Your computer will probably have an optical

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.030
disc drive, also known as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
drive. This has either a tray or a slot where

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.000
you can insert a CD, DVD, or even a Blu-ray
disc, if it's a newer computer.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you have blank CD-R or DVD-R discs, you can
write – or burn – data onto them.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.729
For convenience, your computer may have audio
ports and USB ports on the front. That makes

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.180
it easier to plug in your phone, headphones,
or USB flash drive.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.600
You can also find audio and USB ports on
the back of the computer. You’ll usually

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.429
have several USB ports so that you can plug
in all of the peripherals that you need.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:36.500
The power socket is also found on the back,
and this is where you'll connect the power cord.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.670
To connect your computer to the internet,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.899
you can use an Ethernet cable to connect your
Ethernet port to your modem or router.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.439
This port looks a lot like a telephone port,
but it's a little bit wider.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.969
You’ll use your computer’s monitor port
to connect the monitor. There are many different

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.560
types of monitor ports. This computer has
a VGA port, but your computer

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.560
may have a different kind, such as DVI or HDMI.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.920
Expansion slots allow you to upgrade your
computer by adding expansion cards. For example,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.780
you can add a graphics card to get better
gaming performance.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.490
Many computers use PS/2 ports to connect the
mouse and keyboard. The mouse port is usually

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.860
green, and the keyboard port is usually purple.
If you have a USB mouse and keyboard, then

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.020
you won't need to use these ports.
Finally, some computers have a serial port

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.390
and a parallel port for connecting to older
peripherals such as printers. But today most

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.130
devices use the USB ports instead.
So those are the main types of buttons and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.890
ports that you’ll find on a desktop computer.
Your computer may have the ports in different

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.000
places, and it may even have a different type
of port, but chances are,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
most of these basic parts are there.
