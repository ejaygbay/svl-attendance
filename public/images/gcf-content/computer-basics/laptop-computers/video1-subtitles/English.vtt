00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.820
If you're thinking of buying a computer, you
may have wondered: Is a laptop right for me?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.570
Depending on how you plan to use it, the answer
may be "yes."

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.890
In this video, we'll look at some of the ways
that a laptop is different from a desktop,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.500
to help you decide.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.300
The biggest difference is portability.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.690
Laptops have to be small and light so that
you can pick them up and take them with you.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.170
Since all of the basic parts are built-in,
setting up a laptop is as easy as opening

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.170
it.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.769
The downside is that the monitor is usually
smaller than a desktop monitor, so you'll

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.020
have less screen space.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.590
Another important difference is that laptops
use a battery.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.050
The battery can provide power to the laptop
when you're on the go, and it will recharge

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.350
whenever it's plugged in.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.140
An added benefit of having a battery is that
if the power goes out, the battery can work

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.190
as a backup power source.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.590
Instead of a mouse, laptops usually have a
built-in touchpad, also known as a trackpad.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.320
You can control the pointer on the screen
by using a drawing motion with your finger.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.850
If you haven't used a touchpad before, the
experience is a little bit different from

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.260
using a mouse, and it may take a while to
get used to.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.010
If you're buying a desktop computer, you can
mix and match almost any monitor, keyboard,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.640
and mouse that you want.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.310
With a laptop, you won't have quite as much
freedom, since everything is built-in.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.420
However, if you want to have the best of both
worlds, you can use your laptop's ports to

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.350
connect a separate monitor, keyboard, and
mouse -- basically turning your laptop into

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.810
a desktop.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.280
And of course, whenever you want to, you can
simply disconnect everything and take your

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.979
laptop with you.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.250
As you can see, there are some important differences
between laptops and desktops.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.720
So depending on your preferences, you can
decide which one best suits your needs.
