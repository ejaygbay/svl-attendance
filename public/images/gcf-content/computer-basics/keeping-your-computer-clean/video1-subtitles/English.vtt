00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.270
It's important to keep your computer clean
- not only because it looks nice, but also

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.490
because things like dust and dirt can affect
your computer's performance. But there's a

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.380
right way and a wrong way to do it. Here's
the right way to clean your computer case,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.700
monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
First, always turn off or unplug the item

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.520
before you clean it, just to be safe. If it
has a PS/2 connector like this, make sure

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.840
the computer is shut down - both when you
unplug the cable, and when you plug it back in.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.670
To clean your keyboard, turn it upside down,
and gently shake it to remove any dust, dirt,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.690
or crumbs. It's not uncommon for stuff to
get stuck inside, which can affect the way

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.940
your keyboard works. You can also use a can
of compressed air to really get between the keys.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.940
To clean the surface, use a cotton cloth or
paper towel that's moistened with rubbing

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.280
alcohol. Never actually pour alcohol (or any
other liquid) on your keyboard. If you spill

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.400
something by accident, don't panic. Shut your
computer down immediately, then disconnect

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.920
the keyboard, and turn it upside down so the
liquid can drain.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.750
If the liquid is sticky, you can rinse your
keyboard under running water just like this,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.030
turned to the side. Then let it drain upside
down for two days before reconnecting it.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.330
It may not be repairable at this point, but
it's worth a try. The best way to avoid this

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.710
is to keep drinks away from the computer area
all together.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.880
Next, take a look at your mouse. If you have
an optical mouse, good news - these don't

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.850
require much cleaning at all, because they
don't have any moving parts. Just keep an

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.390
eye on the light emitter underneath. If something
gets stuck here (even a piece of dust), it

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.250
can keep your mouse from working smoothly.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.830
To clean a mechanical mouse - again, make
sure it's unplugged. Then remove the tracking

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.970
ball by turning the ring counter-clockwise.
It should pop right out. Use a cotton cloth

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.670
or paper towel to wipe it with a little rubbing
alcohol. You can wipe the inside of the mouse

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.590
too. Make sure all the parts are dry before
you put them back together.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.500
Here's an easy tip. You can give your mouse
a quick cleaning by rubbing it back and forth

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.910
on a clean, white sheet of paper. Sometimes
this is enough to remove the dust and dirt

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.780
that can get stuck underneath.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.610
Your monitor is going to be even easier to clean,
but there are a few things to keep in mind.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.450
Never spray the screen directly - with water,
cleaner, or any other kind of liquid. It can

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.000
leak into the monitor, and damage the components
inside. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.600
Never use glass cleaner (like Windex). This can
damage your screen if it has an anti-glare coating.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.440
The safest method is to unplug the monitor, then
then wipe it with a soft cloth moistened with water.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.110
You should also give some thought to cleaning
other parts of your workspace, like the back

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.630
of your monitor, and your computer case. These
areas can get pretty dusty if you're not careful.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.800
A lint-free cloth (sometimes called a microfiber
cloth) is great for wiping the casings. If

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.650
you see a lot of build-up in the ventilation
fans, you can use a can of compressed air

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.600
to clean them out.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.930
Never use furniture cleaner or strong solvents
on any of these surfaces. Instead, take your

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.460
cloth or even a paper towel, and spray it
with glass cleaner. Now wipe the case and

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.370
monitor housing (but not the monitor screen)
in a downward motion. You can make your own

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.470
solution using ammonia diluted with water
- the milder the better.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.180
One more thing you can do to make sure your
computer stays physically healthy is to watch

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.060
the airflow around the case.
That means no books, no stacks of paper - nothing

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.320
that might block the fans in the back, which
are designed to keep your computer from overheating.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.060
In fact, if you have a desk with a compartment
for the case, you may want to position the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.420
case a little towards the front, or leave
the compartment open if it has a door. Both

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.420
of these steps will help your computer stay
cool.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.680
Looks good to me! Just remember to clean your
equipment regularly - the right way - and

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.090
your computer is sure to stay healthy for
years to come.
