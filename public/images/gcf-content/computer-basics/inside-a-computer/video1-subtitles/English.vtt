00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.730
You may already know that there are a lot
of important parts inside a desktop computer,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.410
but what exactly do they do?

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.120
In this video, we're going to take a look
inside, to show you the various components

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.070
that make a computer work.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.050
Every computer has a large circuit board called
a motherboard.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.140
This contains some of the most important parts
of your computer such as the CPU, also called

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.670
the Central Processing Unit or processor.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.400
The CPU is sometimes called the brain of the
computer, because it processes information

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.490
and carries out commands.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.030
Since it tends to get hot, it's covered by
a piece of metal called a heat sink, which

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.840
draws heat away from the processor.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.390
The motherboard also contains your computer's
RAM, or Random Access Memory.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.700
This is the short-term memory that your computer
uses whenever it's performing calculations.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.210
However, you can't store your files there,
because the RAM is cleared when you turn off

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.280
the computer.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.850
For long-term storage, your computer uses
a hard drive, which keeps all of its data

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.700
even when the computer is turned off.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.260
Most hard drives use a magnetic platter to
store data, but many newer computers have

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.369
solid-state drives, which are faster and more
durable, but also more expensive.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.479
If you want to upgrade your computer, you
can add expansion cards to the motherboard's

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.340
expansion slots.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.739
You can add a video card to get better graphics
performance, or you can add a wireless card

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:47.130
to connect to your wireless home network.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.260
Of course, your computer's components need
electricity to run.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.990
The power supply unit is designed to take
the power from the wall outlet and send it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.960
to all of the different components that need
power.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.040
A desktop computer is a pretty complex machine,
but now that you've seen what goes on inside,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.060
it should be a little less mysterious.
