00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.480
Today, computers are all around us. From desktop
computers to smartphones, they're changing

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.910
the way that we live our lives. But have you
ever asked yourself, "What exactly IS a computer?"

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.590
A computer is an electronic device that manipulates
information, or "data." The computer sees

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.430
data as 1's and 0's, but it knows how to combine
them into more complex things, such as a photograph,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:51.300
movie, website, game, and much more.
Computers use a combination of hardware and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.930
software. Hardware is any physical part of
the computer, which includes all of the internal

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.530
components and also the external parts like
the monitor and the keyboard. Software is

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.360
any set of instructions that tells the hardware
what to do, such as a web browser, media player,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.619
or word processor.
When most people say "computer," they're talking

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.520
about a personal computer. This can be a desktop
computer, or a laptop computer, which has

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.090
basically the same capabilities but in a more
portable package.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.090
Personal computers come in two main styles:
PC and Mac. PCs are the most common type.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.130
There are many different companies that make
them, and they usually come with the Microsoft

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.090
Windows operating system. Macs, or Macintosh
computers, are all made by one company - Apple

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.570
- and they come with the Mac OS X operating
system.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.040
Computers come in many other shapes and sizes.
Mobile phones, tablets, game consoles, and

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.619
even TVs have built-in computers, although
they may not do everything a desktop or a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.740
laptop can.
There's another type of computer that plays

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.700
an important role in our lives: servers. A
server serves information to other computers

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.910
on a network. In fact, every time you use
the internet, web servers deliver the web

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.950
pages that you want to see to your computer.
Servers are also used in many offices to store

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.720
and share files.
As you can see, there are many different types

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.960
of computers out there, and they affect our
lives in a variety of ways.
