00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.180
Your computer allows you to do many different
things and store a lot of important files.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.920
So it's important to protect your computer
and keep it running smoothly.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.230
One of the biggest computer threats is malware.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.190
Malware is any type of software that is designed
to damage your computer or gain unauthorized

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.580
access to your personal information.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.350
This can include viruses, spyware, Trojan
horses and other types of software.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.280
Any computer can get malware, although if
you're using a Mac, it's less likely.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.960
To protect your computer, you should install
an antivirus program such as Kaspersky, Norton,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960
or BitDefender.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.850
This helps prevent viruses from being installed,
and it also lets you scan your computer and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.350
remove any viruses that are found.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.720
Keep in mind, no antivirus program is perfect.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.260
To stay safe, you should avoid suspicious-looking
ads or downloads, run regular updates to your

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.030
antivirus program, and also run updates to
your operating system.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.600
To keep your computer running smoothly, Windows
has a couple of tools that you can use: Disk

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.409
Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.369
You can access these from your Start Menu
by going to All Programs, Accessories and

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.130
then System Tools.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.450
Disk Cleanup helps you free up space on your
hard drive by scanning your computer for temporary

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.079
files and other files that can be deleted.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.749
Disk Defragmenter rearranges the data on your
hard drive to help your computer run faster

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.619
and more efficiently.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.179
If something bad does happen to your computer,
you could lose all of your important files.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.759
To prevent this, you should back up your files
regularly.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.899
One way to do this is to buy an external hard
drive and copy your files to it.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.039
To make the backup process as easy as possible,
you can use software like Windows Backup or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.490
Time Machine if you're using a Mac.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.819
Of course, if something happens to your computer
and your hard drive, you'll still lose all

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.240
of your files.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.840
For more security, you can use an online backup
service like Mozy or Carbonite.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.110
You may have to pay a monthly fee to use these
services, but the advantage is that your files

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.209
will stay safe in the cloud, no matter what
happens to your computer.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.489
Following these tips can help you protect
your computer and ensure that all of your

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.829
important files will be there when you need
them.
