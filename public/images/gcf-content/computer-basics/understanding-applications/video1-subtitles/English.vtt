If you woke up on time this morning thanks
to the alarm on your smartphone, or if you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.960
read the news on Pulse every day like I do,
you’re using ‘applications’ – also

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.180
know as ‘apps.’ An app is a program on
your computer or device that allows you to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:46.300
do something. Some apps help you complete
tasks, but others are just for fun.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.190
Here are a few ways you can - and may already - 
use apps in your everyday life.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.390
Mobile apps, which are apps that run on your smart-
phone or tablet, can make your life more convenient.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.860
If you forget your coffee at home, don’t
worry. A mobile app like Google Maps will

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.190
determine your current location and recommend
coffee shops close to work. Apps aren’t

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.220
just for mobile devices, though. If you use
programs like Microsoft Word or Powerpoint

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.310
on your desktop computer at work, you’re
using an app! And when you use Skype on your

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.240
laptop to call family around the world – yep,
you’re using an app. Some apps come

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.200
already installed on your home computer, laptop,
tablet, and smartphone, but you can download

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:03.119
or buy more online. Apps are about communication,
productivity, entertainment, and more…

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.000
So start exploring and you’re sure to find apps
that are just right for the things you do.
